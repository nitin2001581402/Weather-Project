# Weather App

This is a **Weather App** built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The app allows users to search for weather conditions of different cities around the world. The app fetches data from a weather API and displays current weather information including temperature, humidity, weather description, and provides a corresponding image based on the weather condition (e.g., hot, cold, or rainy weather).

## Features

- **Search City Weather:** Enter a city name to get real-time weather information such as temperature, humidity, weather description, and more.
- **Dynamic Weather Images:** Based on the city's weather conditions (hot, cold, or rainy), the app dynamically changes the image URL to match the weather.
- **Responsive Interface:** The app is designed to work across various devices, ensuring a smooth user experience.
