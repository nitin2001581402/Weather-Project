# Weather App

This **Weather App** is built with **React** and **Vite**. It allows users to search for the current weather conditions of any city. The app fetches real-time data from the **OpenWeatherMap API** and displays important information such as temperature, humidity, weather condition, and an image based on the current weather (e.g., hot, cold, or rainy weather).

## Screenshots

Below are the screenshots of the app showing the weather for different cities:
